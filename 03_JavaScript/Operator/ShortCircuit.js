console.log(10 && 30);      // output:- 30 

//Because 10 and 30 both are truethy values . 
//If in AND Operation the first operand is truethy then they return  2nd value.

console.log(0 && 30);       //Output:- 0

//Because 0 is falsy value in AND(&&) Opearation. So they return first Opearand Value.
